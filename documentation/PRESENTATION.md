# Problem Statement

## Healthcare Challenges: Global Impact

### Late Detection Statistics
- 47% of cardiac deaths occur outside hospitals (WHO, 2023)
- 60% of chronic diseases could be prevented with early detection
- Average delay in diagnosis: 2.5 years for chronic conditions

### Real-time Monitoring Gap
- Only 15% of healthcare providers use real-time monitoring
- 89% of patients want remote health monitoring options
- 40% delay in emergency response due to late detection

### Data Analytics Challenges
- Healthcare generates 2,314 exabytes of data annually
- Only 3% of healthcare data is effectively analyzed
- 73% of health data remains unused for predictive analytics

## Market Research
- Global IoT healthcare market: $158.1 billion by 2025
