## Technical Documentation

### Component Architecture
#### High-Level Architecture Overview:
1. Data Collection (IoT Integration): Azure IoT Hub collects real-time data from wearable devices (e.g., heart rate, oxygen levels). Device data is transmitted to the cloud for processing.
2. Data Processing and ML Model Prediction: Data is preprocessed in Azure Functions and passed to an AI model hosted in Azure Machine Learning. The model uses historical health datasets (e.g., Heart Disease Dataset) to predict anomalies and health risks.
3. Notification System: Azure Logic Apps triggers workflows based on the AI predictions, sending alerts via Azure Communication Services (SMS/Email) when health risks are detected.
4. Health Insights and Dashboard: A user-friendly health dashboard is built using Azure App Services, displaying live health metrics, predictions, and alerts.
5. Data Storage and Security: Health data is stored securely in Azure SQL Database or Azure Blob Storage. Azure Key Vault ensures secure management of sensitive health data and credentials.

#### Technical Implementation:

Azure Services Used:
1. Azure IoT Hub: Collects and processes data from IoT devices (wearables).
2. Azure Machine Learning: Trains and deploys the machine learning models used for predictive analytics.
3. Azure Functions: Handles real-time data processing and triggers AI-based anomaly detection.
4. Azure Logic Apps: Automates the workflow to send alerts (SMS/Email) based on the detection of anomalies.
5. Azure App Services: Hosts the health insights dashboard and provides access to real-time health data.
6. Azure Communication Services: Sends email/SMS alerts to users when a health anomaly is detected.
7. Azure SQL Database: Stores user health data securely.
8. Azure Application Insights: Monitors the applicationâ€™s performance and health.

Development Tools:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js + Azure Functions.
- Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, or Azure ML for predictive modeling.
- Database: Azure SQL Database.
- DevOps Tools: Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline setup and application monitoring.

### Security and Privacy
#### Data Security:
- Azure Key Vault: Ensures the encryption of sensitive health data and credentials.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive health data.
- HIPAA Compliance: The platform is designed to comply with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) to ensure patient privacy and data protection.

### Deployment and Scalability
#### Scalability:
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is used for scalable application deployment.
- The system can scale as needed to handle additional users and devices, ensuring high availability and responsiveness.

#### Deployment Process:
1. Development: Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) via Azure DevOps.
2. Testing: Unit testing and end-to-end testing using tools like Postman and Jest.
3. Production: Deploy to Azure App Services for the frontend, and Azure Functions for backend services.
